# Butcher Store React App

Team & App:

Nice to Meat you is your friendly online butcher providing quality meat products across Beef, Pork, Poultry, Lamb & Seafood.
Our theme was boiled down froma  few shared ideas around building out a retail/shopping based idea, testing the waters on an 'uber eats' style clone, and working with nested data structures across multiple categories. Overall we wanted something that would take our current knowledge and expand with new learning in things like Payment API, multiple layers of state and displaying nested datasets in a variety of ways.

The Original MVP was to create a linked Database through to Backend and Frontend Routes, with major technology choices being MongoDB, Node.JS/Express/Mongoose and React.JS Hooks & Component based architecture. We used GitHub for managing our workflow process. Figma for some initial wireframing designs and Zoom/Discord/Slack for collaboratively messaging each other (mostly what files we were touching on so we didnt infinite merge conflict ourselves!).

This app was brought to you by:

Jack Dyball: Backend, Payment and Database extraordinaire
Max Nash: Component man, figma monkey and Author
Gerald (Genfeng) Liu: StyleBot, Bootstrap and Array method powerhouse


Installation instructions & requirements:

A lot of our required packaging is in the package.json, so you should be able to ```npm i``` in the main 'ButcherStoreReactApp'
For hosting locally we recommend using Nodemon ```npm i nodemon``` for the server side (ButcherStoreReactApp) folder.

for the client side (client) folder once dependancies are installed you can boot with npm start.

we have strict ENV components that are not included in this package, including a proxy port, you will need to reach out to an original creator to gain this material if you want to edit the source code.
